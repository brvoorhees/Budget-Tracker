# Budget-Tracker
Provide Income and expenses each month dividing entries into categories so you can see where you are spending the most and better understand the relationship between your income and expenses and where you might look to make some changes.

This is a basic HTML file containing JavaScript that allows the HTML features to actually do things and for data to be stored and removed as desired on a month to month basis.

Downloading the code and placing it in an html file will allow you to open that file in a browser and see the code come to life and provide the service of tracking your spending and income to hopefully help you become better financially.
